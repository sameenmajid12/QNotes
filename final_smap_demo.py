    BUSINESS OVERVIEW
    Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person 
    and organization on the planet to achieve more. We create technology that 
    transforms how people work, play, and communicate across their devices and 
    platforms. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, 
    large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency.
    
    We generate revenue by developing, licensing, and supporting a wide range

    RISK FACTORS
    Our business faces intense competition across all markets. The technology 
    industry is characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and 
    evolving industry standards. Competitive factors include pricing, 
    performance, compatibility, and the timing of product introductions.
    
    We face cybersecurity threats that could significantly harm our business. 
    Security threats are a particular concern for technology companies like us. 
    We devote significant resources to address security threats, but threats 
    continue to evolve and increase.
    
    Quarterly fluctuations in our financial results could adversely affect the 
    trading price of our stock. Our revenue is subject to seasonal variations 
    and product cycles that may result in quarter-to-quarter variability.
