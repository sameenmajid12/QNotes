# ElevenLabs Integration Status

## 🎤 Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING

The ElevenLabs integration is **technically working** but the API key needs permission updates.

## ✅ What's Working:
- 🎤 Voice agent endpoints responding correctly
- 📊 Financial content generation working
- 🎧 Audio player interface integrated
- 📱 Frontend integration complete
- 🔧 Backend handling API gracefully

## ⚠️ Current Issue:
**API Key Permission Missing**: The provided API key `53715d9ad565308e547ed43a4506f39359bfc7b4d725927448de874a80c3973a` is missing the `text_to_speech` permission.

**Error Message**: 
```
TTS failed: 401 - {'detail': {'status': 'missing_permissions', 'message': 'The API key you used is missing the permission text_to_speech to execute this operation.'}}
```

## 🔧 How to Fix:

### Option 1: Update API Key Permissions (Recommended)
1. Go to [ElevenLabs Dashboard](https://elevenlabs.io/app/speech-synthesis)
2. Navigate to your API keys section
3. Edit the existing API key or create a new one
4. Ensure `text_to_speech` permission is enabled
5. Update the API key in the code

### Option 2: Create New API Key
1. Go to [ElevenLabs API Keys](https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it "10Q Notes AI TTS"
4. Enable "Text to Speech" permission
5. Copy the new API key
6. Replace the key in `working_elevenlabs_service.py`

### Option 3: Use Different Account
If your current account doesn't have TTS permissions, you may need to:
1. Upgrade your ElevenLabs plan
2. Or use a different account with TTS access

## 🎯 Current Demo Mode:
The system currently works in **demo mode** where:
- ✅ All voice agent features work
- ✅ Financial content is generated
- ✅ UI is fully functional
- ⚠️ Audio generation shows "Demo Mode - Audio unavailable"

## 🚀 Once API Key is Fixed:
1. The system will automatically detect working API key
2. Audio generation will become active
3. Users will hear realistic financial audio
4. Full ElevenLabs integration will be complete

## 📋 Files to Update After API Key Fix:
- `working_elevenlabs_service.py` - Update API key
- `working_backend_with_elevenlabs.py` - Uses the service

## 🎉 Ready for HackRU 2025:
- ✅ Backend integration complete
- ✅ Frontend integration complete
- ✅ Voice agent interface working
- 🔧 Just needs API key permission update

The integration is **technically complete** - it just needs the API key permission to be enabled!
