    We delivered strong first quarter results with revenue of $42.5 billion, up 6.8% from the prior year. 
    Net income was $13.4 billion, reflecting our disciplined approach to expense management and strong 
    performance across our business segments. We remain committed to our fortress balance sheet strategy 
    and continue to invest in digital capabilities to serve our clients better.
    
    Our Consumer & Community Banking segment generated revenue of $17.2 billion, driven by higher 
    net interest income and strong deposit growth. Corporate & Investment Bank revenue was $12.1 billion, 
    with solid performance in investment banking and markets.
    
    We maintain a strong capital position with a CET1 ratio of 15.9%, well above regulatory requirements. 
    Our efficiency ratio improved to 50.3%, reflecting our focus on operational excellence.
    
    RISK FACTORS:
    Credit risk from potential economic downturn affecting loan portfolios.
    Market risk from interest rate volatility and trading positions.
    Operational risk from cybersecurity threats and technology disruptions.
    Regulatory risk from changes in banking regulations and capital requirements.
    Strategic risk from competitive pressures and digital transformation challenges.
