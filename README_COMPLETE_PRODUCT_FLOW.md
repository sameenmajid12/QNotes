# 🔹 10Q Notes AI - Complete Product Flow Documentation

**HackRU 2025 Project** - Transform 10-Q and 10-K filings into structured SMAP Notes

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Tagline:** "Transform 10-Q and 10-K filings into structured SMAP Notes — the Bloomberg Terminal for students and analysts."

### Core Concept
Just like medical students practice SOAP notes and get feedback, finance learners can practice writing SMAP notes on real companies. AI reviews their work section by section, provides targeted feedback, and highlights missed insights.

## 📋 SMAP Framework (Finance Equivalent of SOAP)

| Section | What Goes Here | Example Output |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **S – Subjective** | What management said (narratives, tone, qualitative insights) | "Management emphasized international expansion and margin stability." |
| **M – Metrics** | Hard numbers, ratios, financials (pulled directly from filings) | "Revenue grew 12% YoY; debt/equity at 1.5x." |
| **A – Assessment** | AI interprets meaning of metrics + narrative | "Strong top-line growth but leverage remains elevated; FX risk flagged." |
| **P – Plan** | Next steps for investor/analyst, compliance or strategy | "Monitor FX hedging strategy, assess debt refinancing options." |
