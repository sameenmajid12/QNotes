    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS:
    
    Our first quarter results reflect the underlying strength of our diversified business model and our ability to serve clients across market cycles. We delivered strong financial performance with net income of $13.4 billion and return on common equity of 17.8%.
    
    Total net revenue of $42.6 billion increased 6.8% year-over-year, driven by higher net interest income reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as strong performance across our fee-based businesses including investment banking, asset management, and card services.
    
    We maintained our disciplined approach to expense management while continuing to invest significantly in our people, technology, and controls. Our efficiency ratio of 55.8% improved from the prior year, demonstrating positive operating leverage.
    
    Credit quality remained healthy with net charge-offs of $1.1 billion. We increased our allowance for credit losses to $17.4 billion given the current economic environment and potential headwinds, resulting in a provision expense of $1.4 billion.
    
    Our capital position remains fortress-like with a CET1 ratio of 15.9%, well above regulatory requirements. This provides us significant flexibility to support our clients, invest in growth opportunities, and return capital to shareholders.
    
    RISK FACTORS:
    
    Credit Risk: Economic uncertainty and potential recession could lead to increased charge-offs in our consumer and commercial lending portfolios, particularly in credit card and commercial real estate segments.
    
    Market Risk: Interest rate volatility and market disruptions could negatively impact our trading revenues, investment portfolio values, and client activity levels.
    
    Operational Risk: Cybersecurity threats and technology failures could disrupt operations and damage client relationships, requiring ongoing investment in security infrastructure.
    
    Regulatory Risk: Changes in banking regulations, including capital requirements and stress testing, could impact our business operations and capital deployment strategies.
