# 🏆 HackRU 2025 Submission: 10Q Notes AI

**Project:** SMAP Finance Notes AI  
**Tagline:** "Transform 10-Q and 10-K filings into structured SMAP Notes — the Bloomberg Terminal for students and analysts"  
**Developer:** azrabano  

## 🎯 Project Overview

10Q Notes AI is a comprehensive educational platform that transforms complex SEC filings into structured, interactive learning experiences. Just like medical students practice SOAP notes, finance learners can practice writing SMAP notes (Subjective, Metrics, Assessment, Plan) on real companies, with AI providing targeted feedback and highlighting missed insights.

## 🔹 Core Innovation: SMAP Framework

| Section | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **S – Subjective** | What management said (narratives, tone, qualitative insights) | "Management emphasized international expansion and margin stability" |
| **M – Metrics** | Hard numbers, ratios, financials (pulled directly from filings) | "Revenue grew 12% YoY; debt/equity at 1.5x" |
| **A – Assessment** | AI interprets meaning of metrics + narrative | "Strong top-line growth but leverage remains elevated; FX risk flagged" |
| **P – Plan** | Next steps for investor/analyst, compliance or strategy | "Monitor FX hedging strategy, assess debt refinancing options" |
